# Least Portals Hub (LPHUB)

## About LPHUB

Least Portals Hub (LPHUB) is a community-driven platform that aims to gather knowledge and competition of the Portal 2 Least Portals (LP) category in one place. LPHUB is dedicated to bringing together users who love the challenge of LP, where the goal is to complete a level using the fewest number of portals possible that is placed by the player.

Our comprehensive map library contains detailed, wiki-style information for maps from Portal 2 and their mods, including strategies and routes for achieving specific portal counts. These guides are designed to assist players of all levels in improving their skills, understanding the game's mechanics better, and finding innovative ways to lower their portal usage.

In addition, we host a leaderboard section for each map where users can compare their accomplishments and compete for having the lowest amount of portals possible. Users can upload their records, along with demo proof in order to get on to the leaderboards.

There's also discussion tabs for each map to act like forum pages in order to talk about possible new routes, alternatives, and overall comments.
